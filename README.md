# Peak Performance Notion MCP

This repository contains a minimal MCP server for connecting ChatGPT to my Notion workspace. It exposes endpoints for search, fetch, create_page, and update_page to allow automated interactions with Notion databases. The server is built with FastAPI and designed to be deployed on Render.
